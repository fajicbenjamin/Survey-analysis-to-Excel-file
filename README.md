# Survey analysis to Excel file

> Simple Java application for reading survey from .txt file and exporting analysis to .csv (Excel) file.

Note that you can find 10 course example .txt files in this repository. Professors are graded by students with letter grades, which this program converts to corresponding numerical values, and put them in .csv files. At the end, it makes new file which calculates average grade for every question on survey.

I included *dist* folder in which you can find compiled .jar version of this application. You can test it by putting in same folder executable file and courses .txt files. Then navigate to that directory and simply type in command line

```java -jar Survey.jar```

Also note that new folder will be created at same location where is the folder with application.
